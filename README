ECLIPSE GUIDE
------------------------------
To develop the project in eclipse (this is assuming that you've correctly pulled or forked the project from the development branch):

1. Using maven to setup your eclipse settings in your top level directory:

   cd /path/to/seck/
   mvn install
   mvn eclipse:eclipse

2. Importing modules (projects) into eclipse:

   File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace > [select path to sec-lib] 

Make sure that you do not check copy project into workspace as this will cause problems for synchronizing with GIT.

3. Repeat step #2 for sec-app and sec-web -- note that you ONLY need to import into eclipse and that you only need to run 'mvn eclipse:eclipse' (step #1) once at the top level directory

------------------------------
SAMPLE APP
------------------------------
To compile/package the sample command line search program:

  cd /path/to/seck
  mvn package

To run

  cd /path/to/seck/seck-app/target/
  java -jar seck-app-0.0.2.jar /search/path "keyword"

------------------------------
TOMCAT
------------------------------
Tomcat is configured to run in place within the top level directory, to use it:

  cd /path/to/seck
  mvn tomcat:run

Point your web browser to http://localhost:8080/seck-web/hello

If you want to use tomcat 6 (or 7):

  mvn tomcat6:run

You will notice that we now have a different port for tomcat 6 (and 7) and the top level directory is no longer seck-web

  http://localhost:9090/
